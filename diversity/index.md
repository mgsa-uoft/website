  title: Equity, Diversity & Inclusion Statement
---


At the _Mathematics Graduate Students' Association at the University of Toronto (MGSA)_, we strive to be a respectful, diverse, equitable, and inclusive community protecting the human rights of all the people and based upon a mutual understanding of the dignity and worth of every person.

Our role as student representatives is grounded in promoting safe, respectful, and supportive learning, working, and teaching environments that are free of discrimination, harassment, injustice, and violence. In striving to become an equitable community, we also work to eliminate, reduce, or mitigate the adverse effects of any barriers to full participation in University and mathematical life.

The strength and vibrancy of our learning, working, and teaching activities are found in the diverse life experiences, backgrounds, and worldviews of all the members of our graduate student community, and we proactively seek to respect, maintain, and acknowledge this diversity.

At the MGSA, we believe in Federico Ardila's axioms:

- **Axiom 1.** Mathematical potential is distributed equally among different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.
- **Axiom 2.** Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.
- **Axiom 3.** Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.
- **Axiom 4.** Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.

In solidarity,
The MGSA Cabinet.
