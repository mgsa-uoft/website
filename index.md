The Mathematics Graduate Students Association (MGSA) is an organization that promotes social and intellectual activities among math graduate students at the University of Toronto. As an offshoot of the Graduate Students' Union (GSU), the MGSA receives funding from the GSU to support its events and activities.

One of the key roles of the MGSA is to provide opportunities for math graduate students to socialize and build community. To this end, we organize a variety of events and activities for our members, including potluck dinners, ice skating, barbeques, movie nights, and outings to the opera, the theater, and local restaurants. We also subsidize some of these events to make them as accessible as possible for all members.

In addition to social events, the MGSA also hosts monthly seminars featuring presentations by graduate students and professors. These talks are designed to be accessible and engaging, and often lead to lively and informative discussions. Free pizza is a regular part of this seminar series.

The MGSA is also committed to protecting the interests of math graduate students within the department and the university. To this end, we appoint graduate students to sit on various departmental committees and have two stewards who represent the math teaching assistants in our union (CUPE 3902).

The MGSA is led by an elected executive team, consisting of a President, Vice President, Secretary, and Treasurer. All math graduate students are welcome to run for these positions or to participate in the various committees.

If you have any questions about the MGSA or would like to get involved, please don't hesitate to contact us at <a href="mailto:mgsa@math.utoronto.ca">mgsa@math.utoronto.ca</a>. We welcome all comments and suggestions.
