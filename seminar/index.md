### Information
The Mathematics Graduate Student Seminar is a weekly seminar for graduate students at the University of Toronto to present mathematics they are interested in. 

Most talks are expository talks about mathematical topics, but we also accept talks about anything related to being a mathematics graduate student. If you are unsure if your talk fits with our seminar, please feel free to reach out to us [mgsa@studentorg.utoronto.ca](mailto:mgsa@studentorg.utoronto.ca).

### Location and Schedule
Thursdays BA 6183 @ 3:00 or on [Zoom](https://utoronto.zoom.us/j/84456163855).

### Signup
We encourage all interested graduate students to sign up and give a talk [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZPMXxpa_eln5Q424Ij1vF_7BM1FUJcnNLZ7Su6ZvgP8/edit?usp=sharing). To sign up you will need to provide a *working* title. 

If you cannot make the usual time, we can move the time if that makes it work for you.

You will be asked to provide an abstract and final title for your talk at least a week before you speak.
